# Battleship Game JavaScript

This is a game I coded from a tutorial in the book 'Head First JavaScript', by
Michael Morrison. It was a great step-by-step learning experience, and I was
able to find out how to utilize Object Oriented Programming, in an engaging
way. The art was provided with the book. I coded the game from beginning to end,
with testing along to way, to make sure it was functioning correctly.

**Technology Used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS**
